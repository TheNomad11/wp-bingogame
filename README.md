# Bingogame - An experimental Bingo plugin for Wordpress
Developed with the assistance of ChatGPT and Perplexity.ai. I'm still conducting some testing.  

This plugin creates a bingo game based on a text. A 3x3 grid of words from the text appears, and players click the words as they hear them for the first time. It’s designed to be used as a listening exercise for language learners.  


## Usage

To use this plugin in a WordPress post or page, insert the following shortcode, replacing the example words with your desired nine words in the correct order.  For example:  

<code>
[bingo_listening words="Parkplätze,Zugfahrkarten,Entwicklung,Schmetterling,Verantwortung,Bewegung,Apfel,Banane,Orange" ]
</code>

A sound effect plays when a row or column is completed.
