# Bingogame - An experimental Bingo plugin for Wordpress
Made together with Chatgpt and Perplexity.ai. I still have to do some testing. 

A text is read and you have a bingo field with 16 words that appear in the text. You have to click the words when you hear them for the first time. To be used in language learning as a listening excercise


## Usage

To use this plugin in a WordPress post or page, add the following shortcode. First you define 16 bingo words, then you define the correct order of the words.  

<code>
[bingo_game words="Parkplätze,Zugfahrkarten,Entwicklung,Schmetterling,Verantwortung,Bewegung,Apfel,Banane,Orange,Traube,Erdbeere,Kiwi,Kokosnuss,Wassermelone, Tomate, Gurke" correct_order="Entwicklung,Parkplätze,Banane,Zugfahrkarten,Schmetterling, Verantwortung, Gurke, Tomate, Orange, Kiwi, Wassermelone, Erdbeere, Bewegung, Apfel, Traube, Kokosnuss" ]
</code>


If all cards  in a row or column are completed, a sound appears.
