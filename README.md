# Bingogame - An experimental Bingo plugin for Wordpress
Made together with Chatgpt and Perplexity.ai. It works for me but I still have to do some testing. 


## Usage

To use this plugin in a WordPress post or page, add the following shortcode:

<code>
[bingo_game words="Apfel,Banane,Kirsche,Dattel,Holunderbeere,Feige,Weintraube,Honigmelone,Johannisbeere,Kiwi,Zitrone,Mango,Nektarine,Orange,Pfirsich,Quitte"]
</code>

If all cards  in a row or column are completed, a sound appears. 

To be used in language learning
